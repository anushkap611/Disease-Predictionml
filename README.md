# 🩺 Disease Prediction App (Flask + ML)

This is a Flask web application that predicts possible diseases based on user-entered symptoms using a trained machine learning ensemble model.

## 🚀 Demo

🌐 [Live App on Render](https://disease-prediction-nlp.onrender.com/)

## 🧠 Model Overview

The model is a `VotingClassifier` combining:
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine

It is trained on a symptom-to-disease mapping dataset.
